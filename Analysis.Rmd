```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

Import Sequences.csv and print out each sequence.
```{r}
Sequences <- read.csv("Sequences.csv")
print(Sequences[1, "Sequence"])  # HQ433692.1 sequence.
print(Sequences[2, "Sequence"])  # HQ433694.1 sequence.
print(Sequences[3, "Sequence"])  # HQ433691.1 sequence.
```

Count the number of each base pair in each of the 3 sequences. I first calculated the total length of the sequence using nchar(). I then took out all of the A in the sequence, calculated the length and subtracted that from the total length to get the number of A in the sequence. I repeated this for each base in each sequence by using a for loop.
```{r}
totalLength <- c()
baseCounts <- c()
for (i in 1:3){
  totalLength <- c(totalLength, nchar(as.character(Sequences[i, "Sequence"])))
  baseCounts <- c(baseCounts, totalLength - nchar(gsub("A", "", Sequences[i, "Sequence"])))
  baseCounts <- c(baseCounts, totalLength - nchar(gsub("T", "", Sequences[i, "Sequence"])))
  baseCounts <- c(baseCounts, totalLength - nchar(gsub("C", "", Sequences[i, "Sequence"])))
  baseCounts <- c(baseCounts, totalLength - nchar(gsub("G", "", Sequences[i, "Sequence"])))
}
```

Here is a table presenting the number of each nucleotide in each sequence. I set echo = T and results = "hide" so that the output of the print statements would not be displayed on the .html but so I could still see them in the .Rmd in order to produce the table below. 
```{r, echo = T, results = "hide"}
print(baseCounts)
```

Sequence ID | Number of A | Number of T | Number of C | Number of G 
----- | ----- | ----- | ----- | -----
HQ433692.1 | 154 | 114 | 82 | 131
HQ433694.1 | 155 | 114 | 81 | 131
HQ433691.1 | 154 | 115 | 81 | 131

Calculate the GC content (% of nucleotides that are G or C) for each sequence ID. GC content = ((number of G + number of C) / total sequence length) * 100
```{r}
seq1GC <- ((baseCounts[4] + baseCounts[3]) / (totalLength[1])) * 100

seq2GC <- ((baseCounts[8] + baseCounts[7]) / (totalLength[2])) * 100

seq3GC <- ((baseCounts[12] + baseCounts[11]) / (totalLength[3])) * 100
```

Here is a table presenting the GC content in each sequence. I set echo = T and results = "hide" so that the output of the print statements would not be displayed on the .html but so I could still see them in the .Rmd in order to produce the table below.
```{r, echo = T, results = "hide"}
print(seq1GC)
print(seq2GC)
print(seq3GC)
```

Sequence ID | GC content
----- | -----
HQ433692.1 | 44.28%
HQ433694.1 | 44.07%
HQ433691.1 | 44.07%

Import GC_content.csv and the ggplot2 and dplyr librarys. I included warning = FALSE and message = FALSE so that the warning messages did not show in the html.
```{r, warning = FALSE, message = FALSE}
library(ggplot2)
library(dplyr)

GCcont <- read.csv("GC_content.csv")
head(GCcont)  # View the first few rows of GCcont.
```

Calculate %GC content for each of the specimens and add this in a new column. %GC content = %G + %C
```{r}
GCcont <- mutate(GCcont, GCpercent = G + C)
```

Here is a scatterplot of %GC for each of the specimens, separated by species. Using the clean theme for presentations and publications used in the Colautti Lab.
```{r}
theme_pubworthy <- function (base_size = 12, base_family = "") {
  theme_classic(base_size = base_size, base_family = base_family) %+replace% 
    theme(
      axis.text = element_text(colour = "black"),
      axis.title.x = element_text(size=18),
      axis.text.x = element_text(size=12),
      axis.title.y = element_text(size=18,angle=90),
      axis.text.y = element_text(size=12),
      axis.ticks = element_blank(), 
      panel.background = element_rect(fill="white"),
      panel.border = element_blank(),
      plot.title=element_text(face="bold", size=24),
      legend.position="none"
    ) 
}

qplot(x = Species, y = GCpercent, data = GCcont, colour = Species, alpha = I(0.4)) + theme_pubworthy()
